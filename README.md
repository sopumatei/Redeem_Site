# Redeem Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f105ed0a-0222-4de7-a86d-f11e069a10de/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gianis-codes/deploys)

Description:

This is a simple redeem site. Every 2 hours, you get a code that you can redeem, until you redeemed all of the available codes.

It was awesome creating it, especially working with dates and converting different time units. Pretty simple, but cool.
Besides this, I used Local Storage to store the user's redeemed codes.
